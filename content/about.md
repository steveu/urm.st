# I Heart Product

So I’m Steve, a full-stack Digital Product Designer. I’ve been lucky enough to spend 15 years working across Design, UX, Software Development and Product Management, developing a skill-set particularly suited to cross-functional Product Teams.

Using core strengths in Interface Design, Interaction Design and Frontend Development (JavaScript, React, Angular, HTML & CSS); I deliver elegant and effortless web-based products.

I live with my beautiful wife Sarah and boys Hugo & Fraser in our home city of York. I love playing golf to a high level, am a proud foodie and have been known to DJ a good party.
