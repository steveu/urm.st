# I Heart Product

Hi, I’m Steve Urmston — a Frontend Developer and UI Designer with over 20 years’ experience spanning Design, UX, Software Development, and Product Management. My background makes me particularly effective in cross-functional product teams, where design and engineering meet.

With strengths in Interface Design, Interaction Design, and Frontend Development (JavaScript/TypeScript, HTML, CSS), I focus on delivering elegant, intuitive web-based products that feel effortless to use.

I live in my hometown of York with my amazing wife Sarah and our two boys, Hugo and Fraser. Outside of work, I’m into hand-tool woodworking, playing competitive golf, and hunting down great food.
