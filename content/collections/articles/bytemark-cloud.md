### Why backups?

From our regular meetings and interviews with customers, Kim Witten (our Research Manager) and myself identified backups as both a consistent pain point, and an area where our product lacked coverage.

We often saw anxiety from customers who did not have, or were not sure they had the backups they might need in a crisis. Others had found peace of mind through custom scripting, but at the expense of ongoing maintenance and storage costs.

> “I always have that bit of doubt whether the backup is actually running”

### A five day design sprint

We decided to meet this opportunity by recruiting people from across the organisation for a five day [Google Ventures design sprint](http://www.gv.com/sprint/).

On day one, we developed our **long term goal**, and chose a narrow target of existing cloud customers, and two task to prototype; configuring backups and restoring from a backup. By day 4 we had gone through various groups design exercises and were ready to prototype and test.

### User testing a prototype

Our prototype was built in a day using our existing product as a framework. Although we took plenty of shortcuts, this was tough going and our stress levels and coding skills were challenged.

I would happily exchange this process for a prototyping tool. That said the result was good, and really helped the existing customers we recruited for user testing understand how the feature would work with their setups.

### Building a Beta

I used the outcomes from our usability research to sketch out an interface that was both highlight configurable to account for complicated backup scheduling, whilst attempting to keep the whole process simple for customers to use without much effort.

### Easy backups for everyone, by default

Backups were a technically demanding challenge for the Engineering team at Bytemark, and myself as an inexperienced Product Manager. We had to compromise over the feature set we could deliver to customers without proving revenue, and particularity around pricing when backups ended up being a much larger cost to the business that was ever anticipated.

I'm immensely proud of the simple pricing structure I developed that was fair to those customers who chose to use it fully and to the company's investment, but still provided the free service by default for all customers and
