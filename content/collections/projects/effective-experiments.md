I led the frontend rebuild of a legacy Conversion Rate Optimisation product using React and GraphQL. This project was sadly cut short due to company funding issues.

The app was built to exacting design standards around a component library (React/Storybook) which I developed. This library was then used in a React application using a GraphQL API. The fledgling app also featured integrated staff administration, automatically built from config files.
