I led the frontend development of a rebuild of the legacy company product using React and GraphQL (Apollo).

The app was built to exacting design standards using a component library I developed in Storybook. The component library was used in a React/GraghQL application (React-Apollo), which also also featured an integrated staff administration tool built using table and form components from config files.
