I led the frontend rebuild of a legacy Conversion Rate Optimisation product, modernising it with React and GraphQL. I designed and developed a component library using React and Storybook, built to a high design standard, which served as the foundation for the new application.

The app included integration with a GraphQL API and auto-generated staff admin tools driven by config files. While the product didnâ€™t reach full launch due to changes in company direction, the work delivered a solid and scalable foundation for future development.
