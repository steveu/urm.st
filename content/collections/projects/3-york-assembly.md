description:
  - My MSc dissertation involved the build of a custom Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) and a real world experiment with 107 students to measure the effect game mechanics had on participation.
  - My research hypotheses were somewhat successful, however the VLE app I made was well received and remained in use after research had ended.
