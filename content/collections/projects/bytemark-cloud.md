A Cloud hosting product Iâ€™ve worked on since 2014 when I designed and built an influential JavaScript application using AngularJS, with Node/Grunt based tooling. The app utilises ten separate APIs and is tested in Protractor and using Selenium browser integration tests.

I also led the product strategy for a period. Specifying and launching new features to drive revenue, and conducting customer & usability research to ensure it stays relevant in a competitive market.
