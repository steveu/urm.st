A Cloud hosting product Iâ€™ve been heavily involved with since I designed and built an influential JavaScript application (AngularJS) back in 2014.

I also led the product strategy for a period. Specifying and launching new features to drive revenue, and conducting customer & usability research to ensure it stays relevant in a competitive market.
