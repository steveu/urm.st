A Cloud hosting product I worked on from 2014, when I designed and built an influential JavaScript application using AngularJS and Node/Grunt based tooling. The app uses ten separate APIs and is tested in Protractor and using Selenium browser integration tests.

I also led the product strategy for a period. Specifying and launching new features to drive revenue, and conducting customer & usability research to ensure it stays relevant in a competitive market.
