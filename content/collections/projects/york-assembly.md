My MSc dissertation involved the build of a custom Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) and an experiment with 107 undergraduate students to measure the effect game mechanics had on participation and engagement.

My research hypotheses were somewhat successful, however the VLE app I made was well received, and remained in use after research had ended.
