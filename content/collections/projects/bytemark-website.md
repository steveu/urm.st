A responsive website showcasing Bytemark products, services and company. I’ve worked on several iterations since 2014, also helping to build a Styleguide and a custom static site builder behind the scenes.

More recently my focus has been supporting the Marketing team, implementing comprehensive analytics and conversion rate optimisation tactics to drive sign ups for the company’s flagship Cloud product.
