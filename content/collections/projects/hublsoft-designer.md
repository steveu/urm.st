At Hublsoft, I played a key role in designing and developing a platform which enables users to build digital twins of their businesses. I led the end-to-end delivery of a data mapping feature which streamlined the import and mapping of spreadsheet data, significantly accelerating customer prototyping.

The design patterns I introduced were also adopted by the data science team to support integration of various data sources, improving scalability across the platform.
