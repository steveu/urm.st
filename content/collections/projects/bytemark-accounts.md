I led the UI design and frontend development of an app for Bytemark staff to manage accounts and billing. The design is bright and considered, and works across mobile devices.

Built in React/Redux using Webpack and ES6, the app includes custom form components to handle data entry and API CRUD using configuration files. It strongly follows a container/component pattern, and is well tested using Enzyme/Jest.
