description:
  - A prototype built in 2012 to help Web Designers generate code for highly-responsive web forms. Despite positive feedback, I struggled to find a business model that allowed me to finish.
  - Iâ€™m proud of the UI and interaction design, and my code to handle Drag+Drop, Undo+Redo and auto saving with a freshly released AngularJS. So the project was still a personal success.
