description:
  - A prototype built in 2012 to help Web Designers generate code for highly-responsive web forms. Despite positive feedback, I didn’t understand enough about business to find a viable payment model.
  - I’m proud of the UI and interaction design and my code to handle Drag+Drop & Undo+Redo with a freshly released AngularJS. So I do see this as a successful learning experience.
