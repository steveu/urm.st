description:
  - A prototype built in 2012, designed to help Web Designers generate code for highly-responsive web forms. Despite positive feedback I struggled to find a business model.
  - Iâ€™m proud of the UI and interaction design, and the frontend code I wrote to manage drag+drop, undo+redo and automatic saving with a new framework AngularJS. So the project was still a personal success.
